						 &star; &star;&star;&star; Michelle&colon; <br> I think the best part is meeting other children my age, and understanding that it is ok to ask questions. Being at the center helped me interact and become more social, as COVID-19 made us stay home the longest. The teachers are very patient, and even if you're shy, they encourage you to speak up. I encourage you to join us today!

						&star; &star;&star;&star; &star; Stephanie&colon;  <br> I appreciated how the center provides a safe place for my daughter before I pick her up from work. She comes home in a much lighter mood, and her grades have improved. I commend the ministry for this initiative. <br> <br>
